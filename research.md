<!-- ## High Performance Computing -->

<!-- ### GPU Computing -->

<!-- GPU devices provides a great computing power with a low power consumption. Many applications may benefit from GPU acceleration. -->

<!-- - Use GPU as accelerators for compute intensive parts of applications -->
<!-- - Optimize code, algorithm and numerical methods to fit GPU architecture -->

<!-- ### Hybrid computing -->

<!-- The recent heterogeneous architectures provide both CPU and accelerators (GPU, co-processors) that must be exploited concurrently in numerical applications. -->

<!-- - Distribute computations on both CPU and co-processors (GPU) -->
<!-- - Efficient usage of full hybrid clusters -->
<!-- - 'In-situ' parallelism -->

<!-- ## Hybrid remeshed particle methods (semi-Lagrangian particle method) -->

## Simulation of reactive microflow in porous media

- Dissolution of porous calcite samples under acid flow
- Real samples geometry from X ray tomography


## High order remeshing formulas

- Analysis of high spatial order remeshing formulas with dimensional splitting
- Use GPUs to handle high numerical cost

## Hybrid and multi-scale solver for passive scalar turbulent transport

- Use different scales for flow (coarse scale) and scalar transport (fine scale) computations
- Exploit different architectures for flow (CPUs) and transport (GPUs) solvers
