# PhD, Engineer
## Presentation

Currently, I am a research engineer at [Champagne-Ardenne HPC Center ROMEO](https://romeo.univ-reims.fr/) at the [University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne](http://www.univ-reims.eu/). I am involved in a NVIDIA GPU Application Lab in which we help users to benefit from the GPU powered cluster ROMEO. Beside code porting, optimization on GPU and scaling up to hundreds of GPUs, I am interested in algorithms and methods adaptation to heterogeneous architectures. I am involved in several projects on different domains of application such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Chemistry, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

Previously, in december 2014, I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics at Universit√© Joseph Fourier, Grenoble in the [PDE team](http://ljk.imag.fr/EDP/) of the [Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory](http://www-ljk.imag.fr/index_en.php). This work was supervised by G.H. Cottet and C. Picard and funded by the ANR Project HAMM. The main objectives of this PhD were to study the adequacy of methods coupling, multi-scale algorithms and hybrid computing for turbulent flows simulation.

I obtained an engineer's diploma in applied mathematics at [National Institute of Applied Sciences of Rouen](http://www.insa-rouen.fr/) and a master's degree in mathematics and computer science for complex and distributed systems at [Le Havre University](https://www.univ-lehavre.fr/).

## Research

I am interested in the design and the implementation of high performance algorithms and numerical methods. Heterogeneous parallelism is mandatory and needs to be taken into account not only on the algorighm level but also on the numerical method itself.

Keywords :

- High performance computing
- GPU computing
- Hybrid architectures
- Energy aware algorithms
- High order semi-Lagrangian methods (remeshed particle methods)
- High order finite volumes methods
- Turbulent fluid dynamics
