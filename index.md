# Assistant professor

Since 09/2017  I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Pau.

Between 01/2015 and 08/2017, I was a research engineer at [Champagne-Ardenne HPC Center ROMEO](https://romeo.univ-reims.fr/) at the [University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne](http://www.univ-reims.eu/). I am involved in a NVIDIA GPU Application Lab in which we help users to benefit from the GPU powered cluster ROMEO. Beside code porting, optimization on GPU and scaling up to hundreds of GPUs, I am interested in algorithms and methods adaptation to heterogeneous architectures. I am involved in several projects from different domains of application such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Chemistry, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

## Research

I am interested in the design and the implementation of high performance algorithms and numerical methods. Heterogeneous parallelism is mandatory and needs to be taken into account not only on the algorighm level but also on the numerical method itself.

Keywords :

- High performance computing
- GPU computing
- Hybrid architectures
- High order semi-Lagrangian methods (remeshed particle methods)
- High order finite volumes methods
- Turbulent fluid dynamics
