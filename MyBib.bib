  abstract = {This talk presents advances in numerical methods for the simulation of single-phase flow, reactive transport and solid geometry evolution at the pore scale, involving dissolution, precipitation and crystallization, and will be structured in three parts. Firstly, we will present the semi-Lagrangian approach of the problem and the related models, involving particle/Lagrangian treatment of the transport phenomena and reactions, and underlying grids for the diffusion and flow computation. Frequent remeshing procedure is required in order to keep particles on a regular network, in order to avoid holes of information and particle accumulation. This remeshing technique is either high order but can generated sign changes, which is unacceptable in chemistry, or low order but leads to spurious diffusion. An a posteriori kernel selection will be provided in order deal with this difficulty. Secondly, we will describe the validation of the method by a dissolution process of 2D and 3D calcite cores (including experimental validation) with a benchmark approach. Five codes are used to obtain the solution to this benchmark problem, including Chombo-Crunch, OpenFOAM-DBS, a lattice Boltzman code, the present semi-Lagrangian method, and dissolFoam. These codes cover a good portion of the wide range of approaches typically employed for solving pore-scale problems in the literature, including discretization methods, characterization of the fluid-solid interfaces, and methods to move these interfaces as a result of fluid-solid reactions. Results from the simulations performed by the five codes show remarkable agreement both quantitatively based on upscaled parameters such as surface area, solid volume and effective reaction rate and qualitatively based on comparisons of shape evolution. This outcome is especially notable given the disparity of approaches used by the codes. Thirdly, we will focus on the simulations of precipitation and crystallization. This last aspect can include either the rheology of precipitation or the crystal growth, and the ability to manage the divergence of the velocity induced by the reaction and its related evolution of the global volumic mass. Indeed, in this context, a fast change of state from liquid to solid means incompressible but non divergence-free flows.},

  abstract = {This article shows how to consistently and accurately manage the Lagrangian formulation of chemical reaction equations coupled with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by Quintard and Whitaker. Lagrangian methods prove very helpful in problems in which transport effects are strong or dominant, but they need to be periodically put back in a regular lattice, a process called remeshing. In the context of digital rock physics, we need to ensure positive concentrations and regularity to accurately handle stagnation point neighborhoods. These two conditions lead to the use of kernels resulting in extra-diffusion, which can be prohibitively high when the diffusion coefficient is small. This is the case especially for reactive porous media, and the phenomenon is reinforced in porous rock matrices due to Archie’s law. This article shows how to overcome this difficulty in the context of a two-scale porosity model applied in the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes equations, and how to obtain simultaneous sign preservation, regularity and accurate diffusion, and apply it to dissolution processes at the pore scale of actual rocks.},

  abstract = {The goal of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (M-WSN) is to sense a specific environment. A commonly considered objective is to organize the work of the sensors such that they monitor the environment as long as possible and cover a surface as large as possible. While most of the time this problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem we present a new decentralized approach for building a connected dominating set (CDS) coupled with attractive and repulsive forces for the movement of sensors in order to maintain the network connectivity. The approach is implemented as a hybrid decentralized algorithm: DACYCLEM (Decentralized Algorithm under Connectivity constraint with mobilitY for Coverage and LifEtime Maximization). The lifetime and the coverage achieved by our approach are the results of the local interactions between the sensors and were not obtained by the application of a direct op  timization method. We also introduce a new metric, the speed of coverage, to evaluate the balance between coverage and lifetime. Finally, our simulation results show that one single parameter of DACYCLEM is responsible for the balancing between coverage and lifetime.},

  abstract = {Exascale implies a major pre-requisite in terms of energy efficiency, as an improvement of an order of magnitude must be reached in order to stay within an acceptable envelope of 20 MW. To address this objective and to continue to sustain performance, HPC architectures have to become denser, embedding many-core processors (to several hundreds of computing cores) and/or become heterogeneous, that is, using graphic processors or FPGAs. These energy-saving constraints will also affect the underlying hardware architectures (e.g., memory and storage hierarchies, networks) as well as system software (runtime, resource managers, file systems, etc.) and programming models. While some of these architectures, such as hybrid machines, have existed for a number of years and occupy noticeable ranks in the TOP 500 list, they are still limited to a small number of scientific domains and, moreover, require significant porting effort. However, recent developments of new paradigms (especially around OpenMP and OpenACC) make these architectures much more accessible to programmers. In order to make the most of these breakthrough upcoming technologies, GENCI and its partners have set up a technology watch group and lead collaborations with vendors, relying on HPC experts and early adopted HPC solutions. The two main objectives are providing guidance and prepare the scientific communities to challenges of exascale architectures.},

  abstract = {Dans cette thèse nous explorons les possibilités offertes par l'implémentation de méthodes hybrides sur des machines de calcul hétérogènes dans le but de réaliser des simulations numériques de problèmes multiéchelles. La méthode hybride consiste à coupler des méthodes de diverses natures pour résoudre les différents aspects physiques et numériques des problèmes considérés. Elle repose sur une méthode particulaire avec remaillage qui combine les avantages des méthodes Lagrangiennes et Eulériennes. Les particules sont déplacées selon le champ de vitesse puis remaillées à chaque itération sur une grille en utilisant des formules de remaillage d'ordre élevés. Cette méthode semi-Lagrangienne bénéficie des avantages du maillage régulier mais n'est pas contrainte par une condition de CFL.Nous construisons une classe de méthodes d'ordre élevé pour lesquelles les preuves de convergence sont obtenues sous la seule contrainte de stabilité telle que les trajectoires des particules ne se croisent pas.Dans un contexte de calcul à haute performances, le développement du code de calcul a été axé sur la portabilité afin de supporter l'évolution rapide des architectures et leur nature hétérogène. Une étude des performances numériques de l'implémentation GPU de la méthode pour la résolution d'équations de transport est réalisée puis étendue au cas multi-GPU. La méthode hybride est appliquée à la simulation du transport d'un scalaire passif dans un écoulement turbulent 3D. Les deux sous-problèmes que sont l'écoulement turbulent et le transport du scalaire sont résolus simultanément sur des architectures multi-CPU et multi-GPU.},

The applications we have in view deal with the transport of a passive scalar in a turbulent flow. For high Schmidt numbers (ratio of flow viscosity to scalar diffusivity), these problems exhibit two different scales: one related to the flow and the other -a smaller scale - to the scalar fluctuations. This scale separation motivates the use of hybrid methods where scalar and flow dynamics can be solved with different algorithms and at different resolutions. The coupling between these scales is done through the velocity field.},

  abstract = {Cet article présente les résultats d’une étude expérimentale visant à déterminer les effets du taux de turbulence de l’écoulement ambiant (de 5 à 25 \%) sur le fonctionnement d’une hydrolienne et sur le sillage généré. Le prototype utilisé est une turbine tri-pales à axe horizontal de 0,7 m de diamètre. Des cartes de vitesses moyennes et de taux de turbulence ont été obtenues à partir de mesures par vélocimétrie laser. L’analyse des sillages proche et lointain a été effectuée : le sillage proche est caractérisé par un fort gradient de cisaillement et une intensité de turbulence élevée, alors que le sillage lointain est caractérisé par son expansion. Une réduction du sillage d’un facteur 3 cumulée à d’importantes fluctuations d’efforts ont également pu être observées pour les taux de turbulence les plus élevés. Les effets combinés de la houle et du courant sont également étudiés et les avancées des développements numériques pour simuler le comportement de ce type de machine sont présentés.},
